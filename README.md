# Countdown Timer with Interactive Effects

This project creates an interactive countdown timer with some cool visual effects, including falling snowflakes and a particle effect when the user moves the mouse. It also includes an IntersectionObserver to animate elements (e.g., `.card`, `.info-grid`, and `.getbot-card`) as they scroll into view, providing a smooth fade-in and zoom effect.

## Features

- **Countdown Timer**: Displays a simple countdown timer with hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Interactive Effects**:
  - **Snowflakes**: Falling snowflakes are animated using CSS keyframes, creating a wintery atmosphere.
  - **Particle Effects**: Creates particles when the user moves the mouse around the page.
- **Element Animation**: Uses the IntersectionObserver API to trigger animations (fade-in and zoom) on specific elements when they come into view.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- No external dependencies or frameworks (pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
